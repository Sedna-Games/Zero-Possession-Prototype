You can use this font for all your projects, logos websites etc. Feel free to convert it to a webfont as well. Just don't bundle it with your end products, resell it or modify the original files.

To use the custom ligatures you need a software such as Illustrator or Photoshop CC and access the glyphs panel.

To access the glyphs panel in Illustrator go to Window > Type > Glyphs.

To access the glyphs panel in Photoshop CC go to WÝndow > Glyphs.

Thank You!
